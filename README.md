The problem of anomaly detection is a common one and is present in many areas: 
- Fraud detection from bank transaction information.
- Medical field with the monitoring of physiological data of a patient.

We will focus here on banking transactions.

From a dataset, one will determine a decision boundary between anomalies and so-called typical observations without using label information.

Two methods will be used here:
- An anomaly detection technique called isolation forest.
- A Novelty Detection technique, the One Class SVM.
